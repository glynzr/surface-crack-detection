## âœ… To-Do List

- [ ] Download the dataset and preprocess the images (resize, normalize, etc.)
- [ ] Apply different data augmentation techniques to the images (e.g., rotation, flipping, cropping)
- [ ] Split the data into training, validation, and test sets
- [ ] Define 2 CNN architectures: ResNet18 and VGG16 using PyTorch
- [ ] Experiment with models using and without transfer learning techniques
- [ ] Train the model on the training set using the cross-entropy loss function and optimizers: SGD and Adam
- [ ] Use TensorBoard to check accuracy and loss for validation and training, and include graphs in the report
- [ ] Evaluate the performance of the model on the test set by calculating accuracy (with an additional script)
- [ ] Save the trained model for future use in `.pth` format
